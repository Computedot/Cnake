# Cnake
A simple snake game written in C, using ncurses, so it only runs on linux systems. It's my first programming project. I wanted to add more features to it, such as basic menus, logs that keep track of scores, but I kinda lost my interest in this project after a bit. Sometime I plan to continue learning C, but right now I have to focus on studies. &lt;3
